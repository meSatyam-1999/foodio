#Igniting our app :-


> Create html,css & javascript file nd link it together.

> Git Initialize

> npm set-up (npm init) 

> Install Parcel bundler (npm i -D parcel) 

> Create a ".gitignore" file nd skip the node module. (/node_modules)

> After installing parcel bundler we ignite our app - (npx parcel index.html)

        - npm => For installing a package.
        - npx => For executing a package.

> Now we want to use react in our project for that we use 2 paths 

        - Use CDN links (not recommended)
        - By typing (npm install react) {recommended}

> We also install react dom in our project

        - (npm i react-dom)

> Remove the main script in package,json to run the parcel command.

        - After that run a code (npx parcel build index.html) it generates two new folder - (dist)
        & (.parcel-cache)
        
        - If we delete these 2 folders . we also re-generate it by (npx parcel index.html)

> Put dist & .parcel-cache folder inside .gitignore.
